# 🌌 Polarys - Node.js Express Backend

> A well-structured, scalable backend designed to support AI-driven policy simulations for political decision-making — from the municipal to the national level.

**Repo:** [vittorioexp/polarys-nodejs-express-backend](https://github.com/vittorioexp/polarys-nodejs-express-backend.git)

---

## 🚀 Project Overview

**Polarys** is an open-source backend built with **Node.js + Express** with a clear mission:

> To help public administrators and political decision-makers make better, more informed, and ethical decisions through AI-powered policy simulations.

This project serves both as a **real-world prototype** and as an **example of how to build clean, modular, and extensible Node.js backends**.

While the initial focus is on the Italian policy landscape, the architecture is designed to support multiple countries and regions.

---

## 🎯 MVP Goals

- Accept and process **policy simulation requests**
- Integrate with **LLM (Large Language Models)** to simulate outcomes
- Support **modular architecture** for various policy domains (economy, social, etc.)
- Include **mock agents** for output validation (e.g., AnalystAgent, CriticAgent)
- Include **mock ethical rules validation**
- Log simulations and outputs into a database (Supabase or MongoDB)
- Provide structured output via RESTful APIs
- Be easily deployable on **Vercel** or any serverless-friendly platform
- Be easy to extend to new countries and policy modules

> 🔧 **Note:** Everything is a work in progress and evolving fast. Feel free to fork and contribute!

## 🧱 Tech Stack

- **Node.js** – Backend runtime
- **Express.js** – Web framework
- **Supabase** – Database layer (configurable)
- **ES Modules** – Modern JavaScript structure
- **Vercel** – Hosting and serverless deployment
- **OpenAI / LLM API** (planned) – Policy simulation engine (mocked for now)
